# String-Comparison
Compares each string in List A against each string in List B. For each comparison, a match score is calculated to allow the user to identify which string in List B most closely matches each string in List A in a csv output file. While any string can be used, the project is designed to solve data problems that arise in web marketing and therefore provides specific string manipulation, cleaning and selection options for URLs. It can also download HTML elements for provided URLs and use those elements as the strings for comparison.
